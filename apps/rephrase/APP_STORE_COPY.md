Break through practice plateaus and creative blocks with Contraposeâ€”your pocket-sized practice coach for piano.

**TWO PRACTICE MODES**

ðŸŽ¯ GENERAL PRACTICE MODE
Draw thoughtful prompts designed to deepen your awareness and technique:
â€¢ Physical awareness (breathing, tension, touch)
â€¢ Active listening (recording, acoustics, overtones)
â€¢ Tempo control (elastic time, silence, rhythmic displacement)
â€¢ Musical expression (dynamics, gestures, phrasing)
â€¢ Piano technique (pedaling, voicing, hand independence)

The app intelligently rotates through practice areas you haven't worked on recently, ensuring balanced development across all skills.

âœ¨ IMPROVISATION MODE
Spark creative exploration with randomized constraints:
â€¢ Mood cards set the emotional tone (playful, somber, introspective)
â€¢ Technical cards provide creative boundaries (form, rhythm, pitch, hand position)

Each combination creates a unique creative challengeâ€”perfect for warming up, creative breaks, or developing improvisational confidence.

**FEATURES**

â€¢ 73 professionally designed practice cards
â€¢ Intelligent card rotation prevents repetition
â€¢ Two distinct practice modes for different goals
â€¢ Complete library to browse all available prompts
â€¢ Individual refresh buttons to fine-tune your practice
â€¢ Clean, distraction-free interface
â€¢ Works offlineâ€”no account required
â€¢ Privacy-first: your data never leaves your device

**WHO IS THIS FOR?**

â€¢ Piano students looking to diversify their practice
â€¢ Teachers seeking fresh approaches for lessons
â€¢ Improvisers wanting creative spark
â€¢ Anyone tired of mindless repetition

**PHILOSOPHY**

Contrapose is built on the idea that constraints unlock creativity. By focusing your attention on one specific aspect of playing, you develop deeper awareness and break habitual patterns. Whether you're working on a sonata or improvising freely, these prompts help you practice with intention.

No subscriptions. No ads. No distractions. Just thoughtful prompts to guide your practice.
